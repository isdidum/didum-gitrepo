Greetings,

This file structure is created to showcase my individual-side-project (isp) interface outlook.
Initially, started out with a 4-basic functions: multiplication, division, addition, & subtraction.
Later on, power and square-root functions were added. Since the completion of the basic functions,
I have expanded this project to a full-scale web-based calculator application, included Trigonometric functions,
 Hyperbolic function and their inverses, transcendental functions, & matrix operations.
The idea is to learn new syntax and semantics of relative web-based technologies and keeping up with the ever-changing technological world.
