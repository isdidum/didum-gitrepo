##### Greetings,

This file structure is created to showcase my individual-side-project (isp) interface outlook.<br/>
Initially, started out with a 4-basic functions: multiplication, division, addition, & subtraction.<br/>
Later on, power and square-root functions were added. Since the completion of the basic functions,<br/>
I have expanded this project to a full-scale web-based calculator application, included Trigonometric functions,<br/>
 Hyperbolic function and their inverses, transcendental functions, & matrix operations.<br/>
The idea is to learn new syntax and semantics of relative web-based technologies and keeping up with the ever-changing technological world.
